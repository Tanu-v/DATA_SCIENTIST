      <th>Uses</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Head</td>
      <td>* It controls fine, coordinated movements (running, walking, writing, threading a needle, drawing lines). It also coordinates speech (the movements that allow you to speak).<br>
       * It maintains muscle tone and body posture.<br>
        * It processes the information coming from the inner ear related to the balance of the body.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Eyebrow</td>
      <td>* An eyebrow is the stripe of hair about 2 cm over the eye.<br>
        * Eyebrows protect the eyes, if water runs over the face or if there is too much sunlight.<br>
         * The eyebrow's ability to move is also important in facial expression.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Eye</td>
      <td>* Sense of sight, which is one of the most important physical senses2.<br>
       * Improving brain focus, which has proved elementary in treating anxiety and other psychological disorders2.<br>
       * Storage and transference of information2.<br>
       * Focusing light correctly on the retina3.<br>
       * Turning light into electrical signals3.<br>
       * Carrying signals of light, dark, and colors to the visual cortex4.<br>
       * Receiving visual images, which are relayed to the brain5
        
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Nose</td>
      <td>* Allowing air to enter the body<br>
       * Contributing to the appearance and voice of a person<br>
       * Filtering, warming, and moistening the air to remove particles and allergens<br>
       * Providing a sense of smell<br>
       * Cleaning itself of foreign debris extracted from inhalations</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ear</td>
      <td>*The ear has two main functions: hearing and postural equilibrium and coordination of head and eye movements
        * The ear is divided into three parts: the outer, middle, and inner ear1.<br>
        * The outer ear gathers sounds and funnels them to the ear canal, which leads to the middle ear2.<br>
        * The outer ear is divided into several sections, such as the helix, antihelix, superior and inferior crus, the tragus and antitragus, the concha, and the external acoustic meatus, which work together to funnel and direct sound waves to the inner parts of your ears3.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mouth</td>
      <td>* The mouth has many functions, including1:<br>
       * Breathing<br>
       * Talking<br>
       * Chewing<br>
       * Tasting<br>
       * Swallowing<br>
       * Eating<br>
       * Drinking<br>
       * The mouth is the first portion of the alimentary canal that receives food and produces saliva2.<br>
       * It also plays a significant role in communication2.<br>
       * The mouth is the first organ in the digestive system, and it is a cavity in which the teeth and the tongue exist, and the salivary glands are opened3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hand</td>
      <td>* Hands are capable of a wide variety of functions, including gross and fine motor movements1. Here are some examples of how we use our hands2:<br>
       * Gross motor movements allow us to pick up large objects or perform heavy labor.<br>
       * Fine motor movements enable us to perform delicate tasks, such as holding small objects or performing detailed work.<br>
       * Different hand tasks have different coordination and strength requirements.<br>
       * Adapting exercises to avoid stressing joints.<br>
       * Principles of strength training.<br>
       * Examples of a power grip.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tongue</td>
      <td> * The tongue has several functions, including:<br>
       * Moving food around your mouth to help you chew and swallow.<br>
       * Helping you make different sounds so you can speak and form words clearly.<br>
       * Transmitting taste signals to the brain and helping in sensing taste.<br>
       * Secreting mucous and serous fluid which keeps the mouth moist.<br>
       * Facilitating speech.<br>
       * Affecting breathing, especially in sleep.<br>
       * Enabling us to suck, turn food into a swallowable form, and begin the process of swallowing.<br>
       * Being vital for sucking and breastfeeding, chewing, grinding, salivating, tasting, touching, and defending the body against germs.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Foot</td>
      <td>* The foot has two main functions: weight-bearing and propulsion1.<br>
        * It is also flexible to adapt to uneven surfaces and remain stable1.<br>
        * The foot has three sections: the forefoot, midfoot, and hindfoot1.<br>
        * In land vertebrates, the major function of the foot is locomotion2.<br>
        * A foot is also a unit of measurement used to indicate length or distance, equal to 12 inches or 30.48 centimeters3.<br>
        * We use feet to measure height, length and short distances</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Arm</td>
      <td>* The human arm has several uses12:<br>
       * It helps with small, precise (fine motor) movements, such as wiggling your fingers or fastening a button.<br>
       * It allows you to do big movements, like straightening your elbow, raising your arms above your head or doing push-ups.<br>
       * The humerus works in conjunction with the arm muscles to raise forward and lower the upper arm, raise laterally and lower the upper arm, move the arm in small and large circular motions, and rotate inward or outward.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Legs</td>
      <td>* The use of our legs is to help us stand, walk, run and jump while also supporting our weight and maintaining balance.<br>
        * Our legs have bones, muscles and joints that work together to enable different movements12.<br>
        * The muscles in our upper leg include the quadriceps and hamstrings, and the muscles in our lower leg include the calf muscles2.<br>
        * Our legs are adapted for efficient bipedal gait, which means walking on two feet3.</td>
